Update: We conservatively included MOAB, GRSM, MLBS, ABBY, WREF, MCRA, SCBI, JERC, CLBJ, PRIN as sites with issues in the original notification. These sites were found to have minimal issues upon further investigation and were removed from affected locations.","An improved algorithm for classifying and removing noisy lidar points was applied."
